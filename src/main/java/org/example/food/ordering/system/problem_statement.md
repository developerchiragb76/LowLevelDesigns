Design and Implement a Food Ordering System with the below features:-

System has a tie-up with restaurants, where each restaurant has a menu with all the items & their prices.
Restaurants also have a rating feature which could be given from 1 to 5.
Every restaurant has max # number of orders it can process at any given time. Beyond that, it shouldn’t be assigned any new orders until an ongoing order is completed.
Once an order is ACCEPTED, the restaurant can mark it as COMPLETED when the order is ready. This will free up the processing capacity of the restaurant.
Note:- A restaurant can’t CANCEL an ACCEPTED order.
Order will be auto-assigned to a restaurant based on selection criteria.
Eg: Assign by lowest cost or best rating.
Order will be auto-assigned to a restaurant only if all the items in an order can be fulfilled by a single restaurant. Else the order will not be ACCEPTED.
Requirements:

A new restaurant can be onboarded with a menu.
A customer should be able to place an order by giving items, respective quantities & selection criteria.
Restaurants can mark ACCEPTED orders as COMPLETED. Orders once ACCEPTED can’t be CANCELLED by a restaurant.
Order will be auto-assigned to a restaurant based on a selection criteria.
Implement at least one restaurant selection criteria.
A restaurant should be able to update its menu. For simplicity, a restaurant can't delete an item from the menu. Note:- Do not use any database or NoSQL store, use an in-memory store.
Expectation:

Make sure that you have working and demoable & functionally correct code.
Use proper abstractions, separation of concerns, and proper entity modeling
Use appropriate design patterns wherever required.
The code should be modular, extensible, readable, and unit-testable.
Proper exception handling is required.
Restaurant selection strategy must be pluggable
Concurrency handling (BONUS / Good to have)
Unit test cases (Bonus/ Good to have)
Assumptions:

Unique restaurant name
No need to create the user.
Sample test cases:

This is for illustration purposes only.
You can define your ways to take input.
You can use driver class or take input from the console or you can write UTs
Onboard Restaurants
R1: “max_orders_that_can_be_processed_at_a_time”: 5, “Menu”: [Veg Biryani: Rs.100, Paneer Butter Masala: Rs.150], “rating”: 4.5/5
R2: “max_orders_that_can_be_processed_at_a_time”: 5, menu: [Paneer Butter Masala : Rs.175, Idli : Rs.10, Dosa : Rs.50, Veg Biryani : Rs. 80], rating: 4/5
R3 “max_orders_that_can_be_processed_at_a_time”: 1, menu: [Gobi Manchurian : Rs.150, Idli : Rs.15, Paneer Butter Masala : Rs.175, Dosa: Rs.30 ], rating: 4.9/5
Update restaurant menu
ADD: {Restaurant_1, add, Chicken65, Rs.250}
UPDATE: {Restaurant_2, update, Paneer Butter Masala, Rs.150}
Place Order
Order1:
Input: { user: Ashwin, items: [ 3Idli, 1Dosa ], selection: Lowest cost }
Output: Order assigned to R3
Order2:
Input: { user: Harish, items: [ 3Idli, 1Dosa ], selection: Lowest cost }
Output: Order assigned to R2 (Not R3 since it has reached its full capacity from Order1)
Order3:
Input: { user: Shruthi, items: [3*Veg Biryani], selection: ‘Highest rating’ }
Output: Order assigned to R1
Update Order Status:
R3 marks Order1 as COMPLETED
Order4:
Input: { user: Harish, items: [ 3Idli, 1Dosa ], selection: Lowest cost }
Output: Order assigned to R3 (since R3 has COMPLETED Order1)
Order5:
Input: {user: xyz, items: [1Paneer Tikka, 1Idli], selection: ‘Lowest cost}
Output: Order can’t be fulfilled (since none of the restaurants above serve Paneer Tikka)
